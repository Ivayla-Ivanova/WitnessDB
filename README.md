# WitnessDB: A Database for VerificationWitnesses 2.0 (Neo4j)

**Authors**: Ivayla Ivanova

## Summary
Ensuring the correctness of software systems remains a critical goal in software engineering, with formal verification providing strong guarantees through mathematical proofs. Verification witnesses have been introduced as standardized artifacts that capture the verification process to enhance the transparency, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of verification results. Despite their value for validation, benchmarking, and research, these witnesses are currently stored only as individual files within large archives, which is inconvenient for large-scale querying, analysis, and visualization.

This work presents WitnessDB, a system for storing, validating, and explorin verification witnesses using the Neo4j graph database. WitnessDB transforms verification results encoded in Witness Format 2.0 (YAML) into graph structures and allows querying and interactive analysis through graphical and tabular interfaces.
By leveraging the capabilities of a graph database, WitnessDB demonstrates how complex, interconnected verification data can be modeled in ways that potentially unlock new use cases and encourage new approaches to analysis.
